I'm a Computer Science student at the University of California, San Diego, with a passion for creating impactful software solutions at the intersection of technology and human interaction.

## ðŸ”­ What I'm Working On:
- **LifeSaver AR Project:** Designing AR user interfaces to provide real-time health statistics and first-aid guidance using Unity, Node.js, and image tracking technologies.
- **Truck Driving Game:** Developing a video game in which the user drives a truck through a city, which acts as a resume by showing the player my projects and experience through notable locations on the map.
- **Past Projects:** Developed an environment reconstruction tool using ARKit and MeshLab, created collaborative AR experiences, and built machine learning models for medical data analysis.
